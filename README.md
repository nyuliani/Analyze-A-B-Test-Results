## Analyze A/B Test Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 
The goal of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert",
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
My goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

This project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## What do I need to install? 
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv

I recommend to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.
